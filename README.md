-How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
-How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
-How do I approach designing software?

I can ensure that the project that I am working on is functinal and secure by using software testing techneques gathered in this class, like unit testing, intigration testing, regrestion testing, etc. Ensuring it works the way it sould and responds properly is a good starting ground for making sure that code, a program, or software is functional and secure.

The best way to interperet user needs is to study them carefuly and follow them exactly as stated. Asking questions and refining needs and requrments as the project goes along and more infromation is available. 

The best way that I have found to approach designing software is by look at the big picture first to know what exaclty you are trying to acomplish in the end. Then breaking down what needs to be done into smaller more manigable peices. Having direction to what you are doing, as in diagrams and requirment documents also helps in this. Then it is simply building the program peice by peice.
